# drifter

use your browser's poor timers to make rich beats!


## what

drifter is a virtual musical instrument that resembles traditional drum machines,
but has another channel of output that is synchronized using javascript timers,
which are somewhat inaccurate (an [understatement][js-timers-info-website]).

so your beats are played both accurately, and inaccurately, as the exciting randomness
of your computer takes over.


## why

i dunno.
