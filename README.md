# drifter

> use your browser's poor timers to make rich beats!


## what

drifter is a virtual musical instrument that resembles traditional drum machines,
but has another channel of output that is synchronized using javascript timers,
which are somewhat inaccurate (an [understatement][js-timers-info-website]).

your beats are played both accurately, and inaccurately, as the exciting randomness
of your browser's task queue and your computer's CPU takes over.

every piece is unique, no two beats are alike! use them in your work! they're silly!
